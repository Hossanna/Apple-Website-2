You are to clone the apple website with the resources given to you. View and download the resources on your dashboard and extract the zip folder and you will find all the images you need.

You are to create three pages:
	1. TV & Home page
	2. ipad Page
	3. Accessories Page

The images for all pages are in their respective folder names. Tv-home page image is found in Tv-home page folder, ipad page images are in ipad page folder and accessories page images are in accessories page folder.

There are screenshots of the pages you are to design in the individual folders. The image is called screenshot. Open the screenshot image on your system and see a view of the page you are to design.

To make it easier for you, the names of the images are similiar to how they appear in the website. You can know a particular image by its name.

Note:
Images that have .svg extensions can still be used as noraml images. 
example: <img src="./images/logo.svg" alt="Logo"/>
